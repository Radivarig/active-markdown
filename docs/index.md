### Advanced

Pipeable

    activemd source.md > output.html


if filename is .html, it will just wrap the contents in the viewer template

    <span class="AMDElement" data-config="var_name: -20..20 by 2">5 blue</span>

is equivalent to

    [5 blue]{var_name: -20..20 by 2}

Itâ€™s a little verbose, but helpful if you need to
