A (hopefully) straightforward notation for adding interactivity to Markdown
documents, using the document’s own code blocks to provide the logic and
define the relationships between the variables.

*Like so:*

---

Fuel usage is a function of distance divided by the rate of consumption.

    @fuel_usage = @distance / @mileage

Traveling [100]{distance [0..200]} miles in a car rated at
[25]{mileage [5..40]}mpg uses [4]{fuel_usage} gallons.

---

The goal is to provide a simple notation for defining these variables and
linking them to the logic, so that such documents can be easily created and
read even in plaintext form, with minimal loss of information.


## Background

### Regular Markdown

Regular Markdown is pretty rad. It provides a great way to have plaintext
"source code" for content, while still giving useful semantic formatting. Its
output is static, but it doesn't have to be.

### Tangle

The amazing Bret Victor’s [`Tangle`](http://worrydream.com/Tangle/) library
makes it possible to build interactive documents, with variables in text that
can be adjusted, and the output displayed by modifying the text, generating a
graph, and so on. While powerful, the library requires knowledge of HTML and
JavaScript, and the result is effectively a small client-side webapp. Also,
the logic that drives the relationships between the variables is hidden. It’s
possible to [expose the source](http://worrydream.com/TenBrighterIdeas/), but
it’s still separate from the interactivity.

There are similar projects like [R Markdown](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/authoring/using_markdown), but any interactivity is within
embedded modules, not *integral* to the text.

### `litcoffee`

The recent release of Literate CoffeeScript is a really nice approach to
literate programming. It allows for writing a Markdown file that can also be
executed by actually running the code blocks. The file can be either parsed as
Markdown, for viewing as a nicely formatted — yet still static — HTML page.
Or, it can be compiled by the `coffee` compiler into JavaScript and executed.

But what if the HTML representation weren’t static?



## Active Markdown

### Interactivity

Thanks to `coffee-script.js`, it's possible to compile and execute
CoffeeScript *in-browser*. This, combined with a little `Backbone` for
managing the variables and interface, and we get interactive controls that can
gather the state of all the variables, compile the CoffeeScript defined in the
code blocks, execute that code using the current state, and reapply the state
to the variables in the document.

Different controls and outputs can be specified. Even graphs can be embedded,
specifying a function and a range for the `x` values.

`![]



### Notation

The notation is intended to be simple, and *feel* like Markdown. The approach
is use the normal link and image syntax, but with braces instead of
parenthesis and brackets. A simple interpolated variable looks like:
`[alt text/default]{var_name}`, where the text in the brackets is the
plaintext version of the variable (and also serves as a default value). The
token inside the braces is the name of the variable. Names are global, so
using the same variable name again will link those controls.

More complicated controls are specified by adding *configuration* inside the
braces, eg: `[5]{some_number [0...10]}` creates a slider from 0 to 10, starting
at [5]{some_number [0...10]}.

Graphs are effectively embedded images, and the notation is similar.
`![Graph title]{graphFn x=[-10...10]}` will create a graph driven by `graphFn`
over a range from `-10` to `10`.

    graphFn = (x) ->
        return slope * x

![Graph title]{graphFn x=[-10...10]}
[1]{slope [0..20]}

The type of control is determined by the configuration. A simple
`this or that` creates a binary choice between [this]{which_one this or that}.

These variables can then be combined in the code for more complex logic:

    coefficients =
        'this': 5
        'that': -1

    @q1_result = @some_number * coefficients[@revenue]

    if @revenue is 'profit'
        @outlook = 'positive outlook'
    else
        @outlook = 'negative outlook'

Choosing [profit]{revenue profit or loss} results in a
[positive outlook]{outlook}: $[25]{q1_result}.



### Logic

The code blocks, written using CoffeeScript, can do whatever they please. When
executing, every block is concatenated into a single CoffeeScript source
string. The code has access to the variables which are attached to the
top-level `this` in its scope.

At the beginning of the execution process, the current value for each variable
is gathered into a state. The code is then executed, using that state as its
`this` context. The code modifies the state and does whatever it does, then
the state is reapplied to each variable, updating the display of each control
and output in the document.

#### contenteditable

Changing parameters is great, but what if you want to challenge an author’s
assumptions about their logic. Each code block is directly editable, and
*recompiled* each time the document is executed. This means the logic and
relationships between the variables can be modified on the fly, and the
results seen immediately.


    rating = 2 # AAA mortgages
    @growth = (x) ->
        return Math.pow(x,rating)

The growth in our credit default swap operation shows no sign of slowing:
![Money over time]{growth x=[1999..2020] highlight=2013}


## Forward

---While obviously not as powerful as Tangle, a custom document, or things like IPython, and it does
require familiarity with CoffeeScript. However, there is a great appeal in having the
source be a fairly simple plaintext file that exposes its logic directly.

It fills this void of lightweight interactive document creation


The compilation command and are still in need of some user-friendliness and
robustness, but they will be public on GitHub shortly.

The plan going forward is to expand on the notation, and add helpers for
working with graphs and datasets. Also, a more useful editor for the code
blocks, perhaps CodeMirror, is definitely in order.
