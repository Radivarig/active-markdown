<p>An old riddle.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As  <span class="AMElement" data-embed="false" data-config="travelers: we or I">I</span>  <span class="AMElement" data-embed="false" data-config="verb">was</span> going to <em>St Ives</em> <br />
  I met a man with  <span class="AMElement" data-embed="false" data-config="wives: 1..10">7 wives</span> <br />
  Every wife had  <span class="AMElement" data-embed="false" data-config="sacks: 1..10">7 sacks</span> <br />
  Every sack had  <span class="AMElement" data-embed="false" data-config="cats: 1..10">7 cats</span> <br />
  Every cat had  <span class="AMElement" data-embed="false" data-config="kits: 1..10">7 kits</span> <br />
  Kits, cats, sacks, wives <br />
  How many were going to St Ives?</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>total_sacks = @wives * @sacks
total_cats  = total_sacks * @cats
total_kits  = total_cats * @kits
man         = 1

if @travelers
    narrator = 2
    @verb = 'were'
else
    narrator = 1
    @verb = 'was'
</code></pre>

<p>The first guess is often  <span class="AMElement" data-embed="false" data-config="first_guess">2753</span>…</p>

<pre><code>@first_guess = man + @wives + total_cats + total_kits + narrator
</code></pre>

<p>…but the correct answer is  <span class="AMElement" data-embed="false" data-config="answer">1</span>.</p>

<pre><code>@answer = narrator

An old riddle.

> As [I]{travelers: we or I} [was]{verb} going to *St Ives*  
> I met a man with [7 wives]{wives: 1..10}  
> Every wife had [7 sacks]{sacks: 1..10}  
> Every sack had [7 cats]{cats: 1..10}  
> Every cat had [7 kits]{kits: 1..10}  
> Kits, cats, sacks, wives  
> How many were going to St Ives?

    total_sacks = @wives * @sacks
    total_cats  = total_sacks * @cats
    total_kits  = total_cats * @kits
    man         = 1

    if @travelers
        narrator = 2
        @verb = 'were'
    else
        narrator = 1
        @verb = 'was'

The first guess is often [2753]{first_guess}…

    @first_guess = man + @wives + total_cats + total_kits + narrator

…but the correct answer is [1]{answer}.

    @answer = narrator
