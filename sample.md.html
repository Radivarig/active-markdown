<p>An old riddle.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As [I]{travelers: we or I} [was]{verb} going to <em>St Ives</em> <br />
  I met a man with [7 wives]{wives: 1..10} <br />
  Every wife had [7 sacks]{sacks: 1..10} <br />
  Every sack had [7 cats]{cats: 1..10} <br />
  Every cat had [7 kits]{kits: 1..10} <br />
  Kits, cats, sacks, wives <br />
  How many were going to St Ives?</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>total_sacks = @wives * @sacks
total_cats  = total_sacks * @cats
total_kits  = total_cats * @kits
man         = 1

if @travelers
    narrator = 2
    @verb = 'were'
else
    narrator = 1
    @verb = 'was'
</code></pre>

<p>The first guess is often [2753]{first_guess}…</p>

<pre><code>@first_guess = man + @wives + total_cats + total_kits + narrator
</code></pre>

<p>…but the correct answer is <strong>[1]{answer}</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>@answer = narrator
</code></pre>
